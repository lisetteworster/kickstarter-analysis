# kickstarter-analysis
	performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
# Kickstarting with Excel
	Gathering data for pivot charts with the percentage.
## Overview of Project
	design pivot charts.
### Purpose
	I learned a lot about nesting and using functions. But mostly, getting used to the new terminology in excel.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	When I originally brought the data in I wasn't able to get Theater filter from the "Parent Category" I used the "Subcategory" from the Category and Subcategory in the data from the kickstarter after changing it to "Text to Columns".   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Getting the data for this I thought was very straight forward I however misunderstood the directions and thought I was supposed to just solve for the Goals. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
		One conclusion from the data is that much more were successful than canceled. And another conclusion, summer were the best months. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
		If I used my data I would say that it was split pretty evenly 50% in canceled and successful. On the chart that supposed to be correct the conclusion I would draw is that more were canceled at a higher goal.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
		I had to start over when I created tables too many times. It totally messed with the data and wasn't able to refresh it all. I wasn't sure if it remembered the perimeters or had a cache?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
		We could use the average of the percentages(successful/failed/canceled), sum of number successful, sum of total projects by canceled, or count of goals by numbers successful.
