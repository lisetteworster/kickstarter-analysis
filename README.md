# kickstarter-analysis
performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel
	This worksheet was difficult for me in my ways. I was able to get tutoring and do one office hours but for some reason I did not obtain the results I was supposed to get in the pivot charts with the percentage.
## Overview of Project
	I think or maybe hope that on future challenges I will not have as much difficulty. I apologize for how weak this first attempt is but I plan on redoing for the full points.
### Purpose
	I learned a lot about nesting and using functions. But mostly getting used to the new terminology in excel.
## Analysis and Challenges
	I felt as if the analysis of the data was straight forward as long as I am careful of language in the directions. The challenge was different then the practice and through me off a little. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	When I originally brought the data in I wasn't able to get Theater filter from the "Parent Category" I used the "Subcategory" from the Category and Subcategory in the data from the kickstarter after changing it to "Text to Columns". Also the numbers I got for the pivot chart was a lot higher than what i supposed to get but the chart looks correct?  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Getting the data for this I thought was very straight forward I however misunderstood the directions and thought I was supposed to just solve for the Goals. When I got help from my tutor they didn't understand the directions either so I was lead down the wrong path. It was solved by attending one of the office hours today (sunday with sam)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Some of the challenges I encountered were with tables and using 2 different worksheets for one pivot chart.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
		One conclusion from the data is that much more were successful than canceled. And another conclusion, summer were the best months. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
		If I used my data I would say that it was split pretty evenly 50% in canceled and successful. On the chart that supposed to be correct the conclusion I would draw is that more were canceled at a higher goal.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
		I had to start over when I created tables too many times. It totally messed with the data and wasn't able to refresh it all. I wasn't sure if it remembered the perimeters or had a cache?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
		We could use the average of the percentages(successful/failed/canceled), sum of number successful, sum of total projects by canceled, or count of goals by numbers successful.
